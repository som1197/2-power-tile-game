# 2-power-tile-game
This game is based on https://poweroftwo.nemoidstudio.com/1024 where the numbers are added up to reach the overall total/target score which is a power of 2.
To run the game, the base code can be run using any IDE or via python shell. On running, the program asks the user to enter the target value for winning the game. This indicates the power of two required to be acheived on pressing the keys. Currently this value should be set to greater than 4.
