# 2-power-tile-game
This game is based on https://poweroftwo.nemoidstudio.com/1024 where the numbers are added up to reach the overall total/target score which is a power of 2.
To run the game, the base code can be run using any IDE or via python shell. On running, the program asks the user to enter the target value for winning the game. 
This indicates the power of two required to be acheived on pressing the keys. Currently this value should be set to greater than 4. 
On entering the value, the user is free to start playing by pressing any of the arrow keys to navigate the position of the numbers on the game board.
To quit the game, "ESC" key can be pressed. If the user presses any other key except for the arrow keys by mistake, the console displays an "INVALID KEY" message.
